# Multi-Agent Knights Archers Zombies

Project for the Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems 2023 course at Instituto Superior Técnico. Adapts a game from PettingZoo (https://pettingzoo.farama.org/index.html) to have different kinds of agents.

## Usage
-> Install dependencies with `pip install pettingzoo` and also `pip install matplotlib`\
-> Run the game normally with `python kaz.py` \
-> Simple game settings can be altered in the file `src/constants.py` 
- For example, STRATEGY dictates which strategy from STRATEGY_LIST is being utilized 

-> `kaz_multiagent_comparison.py` is a script that creates a comparison graphic between three test cases: Baseline Greedy, Social Conventions and Roles. You can run it with `python kaz_multiagent_comparison.py`
